    * Beginner-Level System Design Questions
1. What is DNS?
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a critical component of the internet. It translates user-friendly domain names, like “www.designgurus.io," into numerical IP addresses, such as “192.0.2.1,” which computers use to identify each other. Think of DNS as the internet’s phonebook. Just as you use a phonebook to find someone’s phone number, DNS helps computers find the right IP address when you enter a domain name into your web browser.

When you type a domain name into your browser, your computer sends a query to a DNS server asking for the IP address of that domain. This server doesn’t always have the answer right away, so it starts a search process. First, it contacts a root server, which directs it to the appropriate Top-Level Domain (TLD) server, such as those for “.com” or “.net.” The TLD server then points to the authoritative name server that holds the IP address for the specific domain. Once the DNS server obtains the IP address, it sends this information back to your computer. Your browser can then connect to the correct server to load the website.

Example:

You type “www.example.com" in your browser.
Your computer asks a DNS server, “What’s the IP address for this domain?”
The DNS server replies with “192.0.2.1.”
Your browser connects to the server at “192.0.2.1” to load the website.

2. What is Load Balancer or Load Balancing?
A load balancer is a device or software that helps manage incoming network traffic by distributing it across multiple servers. This ensures that no single server gets overwhelmed, which helps keep the website or application running smoothly and quickly, even when there’s a lot of traffic.

Load balancers are important because they help scale applications and manage server workloads effectively. When there’s a sudden increase in traffic or if requests are not evenly spread among servers, a load balancer steps in to distribute the load evenly.

Load balancers use different methods to decide how to distribute traffic. Here are a few common ones:

Round Robin: This method sends requests to each server in turn, one after the other.
Least Connections: This method sends requests to the server with the fewest active connections.
IP Hash: This method uses the client’s IP address to decide which server will handle the request. This helps ensure that a specific client’s requests go to the same server, maintaining a continuous session.
Load balancing helps websites handle millions of requests from users efficiently. Here’s how it works:

When you visit a website, your request is sent to a load balancer. The load balancer then decides which server in the group should handle your request. This way, no single server gets too busy, which could slow down or crash the website.

If a server goes down, the load balancer redirects traffic to the remaining servers, ensuring the website stays up. When a new server is added, the load balancer automatically starts sending requests to it.


Here are some benefits of using a load balancer:

It prevents requests from going to servers that are down or unhealthy.
It helps avoid overloading any single server.
It removes the risk of a single point of failure because requests are always routed to available servers.
It handles the encryption and decryption of requests, which simplifies security management.
3. What is API Gateway?
An API Gateway acts as a middleman between external clients and the internal services of an application. It’s a key part of modern architectures, especially those using microservices, as it simplifies communication and provides a single entry point for accessing various services.

Functions of an API Gateway:

Request Routing: The API Gateway takes incoming requests from clients and directs them to the right backend service based on set rules and configurations.
Authentication and Authorization: It handles user authentication and authorization, making sure only authorized clients can access the services. It checks API keys, tokens, or other credentials before passing requests to the backend.
Rate Limiting and Throttling: To protect backend services from too much load or abuse, the API Gateway limits the number of requests from clients according to set policies.
Caching: The API Gateway can cache frequently used responses to reduce delay and lessen the load on backend services. This means it can directly serve some requests without needing to query the backend every time.
Request and Response Transformation: It can modify requests and responses, such as changing data formats, adding or removing headers, or altering query parameters, to ensure compatibility between clients and services.

Why Use an API Gateway?

An API Gateway simplifies the way clients interact with different services. Instead of calling multiple services directly, clients can send requests to the gateway, which then handles all the communication with the backend. This setup makes the system easier to manage, more secure, and more efficient.

For example, if a client wants to access user information and order details from different services, the API Gateway can route these requests to the appropriate services and then return the combined results to the client. This reduces the complexity for the client and ensures better performance and security.

4. What is meant by CDN?
A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a group of servers spread out around the world that store and deliver content like images, videos, stylesheets, and scripts. CDNs improve the speed, performance, and reliability of delivering this content to users by serving it from servers that are geographically closer to them.

Here’s how a CDN works:

User Request: When a user asks for content from a website or application, their request is sent to the nearest CDN server, also called an edge server.
Content Delivery: If the edge server has the requested content cached, it sends the content directly to the user. This shortens the distance the content needs to travel, reducing delay and improving the user experience.
Fetching Content: If the edge server doesn’t have the content, it retrieves it from the origin server or another nearby CDN server. Once the content is fetched, it is cached on the edge server for future requests.
CDNs keep the content up-to-date by regularly checking the origin server for changes and updating their cache as needed.


CDN working
Using a CDN helps improve performance in several ways:

Faster Delivery: Since users receive data from servers close to them, they don’t have to wait long for the content to load.
Reduced Server Load: CDNs share the responsibility of delivering content, which lessens the load on the main servers.
There are two types of CDNs:

Push CDNs: With push CDNs, content is uploaded to the CDN whenever changes are made on the server. This means we need to manually upload the content to the CDN. This type is good for websites with less traffic or content since it maximizes storage by reducing traffic.
Pull CDNs: Pull CDNs fetch new content from the server when a user requests it for the first time. This can lead to slower requests initially until the content is cached on the CDN. Pull CDNs use less storage but can create redundant traffic if expired files are pulled before they are updated. This type works well for websites with heavy traffic.
5. Discuss Forward proxy vs. Reverse proxy?
Forward Proxy:

A forward proxy, also known simply as a proxy, is a server that stands between client machines and the internet. When a client, like your computer, wants to access a resource on the internet, it sends the request to the forward proxy first. The proxy then forwards this request to the internet, retrieves the response, and sends it back to the client. Essentially, it acts on behalf of the client. This is useful for various reasons, such as improving security, managing bandwidth, or bypassing restrictions.

Example: Imagine you are trying to visit a website, but your company has set up a forward proxy. Your request to visit the website goes to the proxy server first. The proxy server then gets the website's data from the internet and sends it back to you.

Reverse Proxy:

A reverse proxy is a server that stands between the internet and one or more web servers. When a client (like a user's browser) requests a resource from a website, the request goes to the reverse proxy first. The reverse proxy then forwards this request to the appropriate web server, retrieves the response from the server, and sends it back to the client. It acts on behalf of the web servers and helps distribute the load, improve performance, and enhance security.


Example: Suppose you want to access a popular website. Your request goes to the reverse proxy server first. The reverse proxy then decides which of the web servers behind it will handle your request. Once the web server responds, the reverse proxy sends the response back to you.

Key Differences:

Position: A forward proxy sits in front of the clients, while a reverse proxy sits in front of the web servers.
Purpose: A forward proxy acts on behalf of the clients to access the internet, whereas a reverse proxy acts on behalf of the web servers to manage incoming requests from the internet.
Learn more about reverse proxy.


6. What is caching? What are its types?
Cache is a high-speed storage layer that sits between an application and its main data source, like a database, file system, or remote web service. When an application needs data, it first checks the cache. If the data is in the cache, it’s quickly returned to the application. If not, the data is retrieved from the original source, stored in the cache for future use, and then returned to the application. This process speeds up data access and reduces the time it takes to get the needed information.

Caching can happen in various places in a distributed system, including the client, DNS, CDN, load balancer, API gateway, server, and database.

Caching helps improve performance by reducing the time it takes to access data. Since the cache can quickly provide frequently accessed data, it lowers the load on the main data source and decreases site latency.

Caching Strategies:

Cache-aside (Lazy Loading):
The application is responsible for reading and writing data to the cache.

When data is requested, the application first checks the cache. If the data is not there, it fetches it from the main data source, stores it in the cache, and returns it.

Pros: Only the needed data is cached.

Cons: Cache misses cause delays, and data might become outdated if the database changes.

2. Write-through:

The system treats the cache as the main data store.

When data is written, it is simultaneously written to the cache and the database.

Pros: Ensures the cache is always up-to-date.

Cons: Slower write operations due to synchronous writes, and some data might be written but never read.

3. Write-behind (Write-back):

The application writes data to the cache first and then updates the database asynchronously.

Pros: Improves write performance.

Cons: Risk of data loss if the cache fails before the database is updated.

4. Refresh-ahead:

The cache is configured to automatically refresh data before it expires.

Pros: Reduces the chance of cache misses.

Cons: Might lead to unnecessary data updates if the data is not requested frequently.


For more information, check out the guide to caching.

7. What is data partitioning? Discuss its types.
Data partitioning is a method used to divide a large database into smaller, more manageable pieces. This helps improve performance, manageability, and scalability. There are two main types of data partitioning: horizontal partitioning and vertical partitioning.

Horizontal Partitioning (Sharding):

Horizontal partitioning, also known as sharding, involves splitting the rows of a table into smaller tables and storing them on different servers or database instances. Each smaller table contains a subset of the rows from the original table.

Purpose: To distribute the database load across multiple servers, enhancing performance and making it easier to scale the database as the amount of data grows.
Example: If you have a table with customer data, you might split it so that customers from different regions are stored on different servers. For instance, one server might store customers from the USA, while another server stores customers from Europe.
Vertical Partitioning:

Vertical partitioning involves splitting the columns of a table into separate tables. Each new table contains fewer columns but retains the same number of rows.

Purpose: To reduce the number of columns in a table and boost the performance of queries that only access a limited number of columns.
Example: If you have a table with customer information that includes contact details and order history, you might create two separate tables: one for contact details (name, email, phone) and another for order history (order ID, order date, amount). This way, queries that only need contact details don’t have to process order history data.

8. What is Data replication?
Data replication is a method used to keep multiple copies of the same database on different servers or in different locations. The main goal of replication is to improve data availability, redundancy, and fault tolerance, ensuring that the system keeps running smoothly even if there are hardware failures or other problems.

In a replicated database setup, one server is the primary (or master) database, while the others are replicas (or slaves). Data is synchronized between the primary database and the replicas so that all copies are up-to-date.

Advantages of Data Replication:

Improved Performance: By spreading read queries across multiple replicas, the load on the primary database is reduced, leading to faster query responses.
High Availability: If the primary database fails or goes down, the replicas can still provide data, ensuring that users can continue to access the application without interruption.
Enhanced Data Protection: Having multiple copies of the database in different locations helps protect against data loss due to hardware failures or other disasters.
Load Balancing: Replicas can handle read queries, which distributes the load more evenly and reduces the stress on the primary database.
9. What are distributed messaging systems?
A distributed messaging system is a tool that allows different applications, services, or components to exchange messages reliably and efficiently, even if they are spread out across different locations. These systems help these components communicate without needing to be directly connected, allowing them to develop and operate independently.

Distributed messaging systems are especially useful in large or complex setups, such as those using microservices architectures or distributed computing environments. By decoupling the sender and receiver, these systems make it easier to manage and scale the application.

Key Features of Distributed Messaging Systems:

Reliable: Ensures that messages are delivered correctly, even if some parts of the system fail.
Scalable: Can handle a growing number of messages and users without a drop in performance.
Fault-Tolerant: Continues to operate smoothly even if some parts of the system experience problems.
Examples of Distributed Messaging Systems:

Apache Kafka: A popular system used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming apps.
RabbitMQ: A widely-used system that supports various messaging protocols and is known for its robustness and flexibility.
10. What are microservices?
Microservices are a way of designing an application as a collection of small, independent services. Each service focuses on a specific function or domain within the application and communicates with other services through well-defined APIs. This approach is different from the traditional monolithic architecture, where the application is built as one large, interconnected unit.

Microservices allow for greater flexibility and agility in the development process. Since each service can be managed independently, it’s easier to update and scale specific parts of the application without disrupting the whole system. This makes it easier to respond to changing requirements and improves the overall reliability of the application.

Key Characteristics of Microservices:

Single Responsibility: Each microservice is responsible for a specific function or domain, making it easier to understand, develop, and maintain.
Independence: Microservices can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. This means teams can work on different services at the same time without affecting the entire system.
Decentralization: Each microservice has its own data and business logic. This separation allows teams to make decisions and choose technologies that best fit their specific needs.
Communication: Microservices interact with each other using lightweight protocols such as HTTP/REST, gRPC, or message queues. This makes it easy to integrate new services or replace existing ones.
Fault Tolerance: Because microservices are independent, if one service fails, it doesn’t bring down the whole system. This improves the overall resilience of the application.
11. Explain NoSQL databases and its types?
NoSQL databases, short for “Not Only SQL” databases, are types of databases that do not rely on the traditional relational database model. Instead, they are designed to store, manage, and retrieve unstructured or semi-structured data. Unlike relational databases, which use structured data and predefined schemas, NoSQL databases are more flexible and scalable, making them ideal for handling large volumes of data, big data processing, and real-time analytics.

Types of NoSQL Databases:

Document-Based Databases: These databases store data in document-like structures, such as JSON or BSON. Each document is self-contained and can have a unique structure. Suitable for handling varied data types. Examples: MongoDB, Couchbase.
Key-Value Databases: Store data as key-value pairs, where each key is a unique identifier, and the value holds the associated data. Highly efficient for simple read and write operations. Easy to partition and scale horizontally. Examples: Redis, Amazon DynamoDB.
Column-Family Databases: Store data in column families, which are groups of related columns. Designed to handle write-heavy workloads efficiently. Excellent for querying data using known row and column keys. Examples: Apache Cassandra, HBase.
Graph-Based Databases: Designed for storing and querying data with complex relationships and interconnected structures. Use nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data. Ideal for applications like social networks or recommendation systems where relationships are important. Examples: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune.

12. What is database index? What are its types?
A database index is a data structure that makes querying a database faster and more efficient. It works like an index in a book, helping the database quickly find the data you need without having to look through every row in a table.

Indexes are created on one or more columns of a database table. When you run a query, the index provides a shortcut to the data, allowing the database to locate the information much faster. For example, if you have an index on a column that stores customer names, the database can quickly find all rows with a specific name without scanning the entire table.


Types of Database Indexes:

B-tree Index: The most common type, it organizes data in a tree-like structure that allows for quick search, insertion, and deletion.
Bitmap Index: Used for columns with a limited number of distinct values, like gender or yes/no fields.
Hash Index: Uses a hash function to map data to fixed-size slots, making lookups very fast.
Benefits of Using Indexes:

Faster Queries: Indexes significantly reduce the time it takes to retrieve data from a database.
Efficient Data Access: They provide a direct route to the data, which is much quicker than scanning the entire table.
Trade-offs of Using Indexes:

Storage Space: Indexes require extra storage space because they create and maintain separate data structures alongside the original table data.
Write Performance: When data is added, updated, or deleted, the indexes need to be updated as well, which can slow down these write operations.
13. What are distributed file systems?
A distributed file system is a storage system that manages files and directories across multiple servers, nodes, or machines. These systems allow users and applications to access and modify files as if they were on a local file system, even though the files are actually spread out across different remote servers.

Distributed file systems are especially useful in large-scale or distributed computing environments. They ensure that files are always available and accessible, even if some servers fail. This makes them ideal for businesses and applications that need reliable and fast access to large amounts of data spread out over multiple locations.

Key Features of Distributed File Systems:

File Access and Modification: Users can access and change files as though they are stored locally, making it easy to work with files even if they are on different servers.
Fault Tolerance: If one server fails, the system can still function because the files are stored on multiple servers.
High Availability: Files are always accessible, even if some parts of the system are down.
Enhanced Performance: By distributing files across many servers, the system can handle more requests and work more efficiently.
14. Explain full-text search.
Full-text search is a feature that lets users search for specific words or phrases within an application or website. When a user enters a query, the system quickly finds and shows the most relevant results.

To search efficiently, full-text search uses a special data structure called an inverted index. This index links each word or phrase to the documents where they appear. Instead of scanning every document to find a match, the system can quickly look up the word in the index and find all related documents.

Example:

ElasticSearch is a popular system that uses full-text search. It helps find relevant information quickly and effectively.

15. What are distributed coordinated services?
Distributed coordination services are systems designed to manage and synchronize the activities of distributed applications, services, or nodes. They ensure these components work together in a reliable, efficient, and fault-tolerant manner.

Key Functions of Distributed Coordination Services:

Consistency: They help keep data consistent across different parts of the system.
Synchronization: They manage the timing and coordination of actions across various components.
Configuration and State Management: They oversee the settings and current state of different components in the system.
These services are particularly useful in large or complex systems, such as those using microservices architectures, distributed computing environments, or clustered databases. They help ensure everything runs smoothly and efficiently, even as the system scales up.

Examples:

Apache ZooKeeper: Manages configuration and synchronization of data.
Etcd: Stores configuration data and coordinates cluster states.
Consul: Provides service discovery, configuration, and synchronization.
16. What is heartbeat in distributed systems? Explain its types.
In a distributed system, tasks and data are spread across multiple servers. To keep things running smoothly, servers need to know which other servers are part of the system and if they are working properly. This is where the concept of a "heartbeat" comes in.

Heartbeat mechanisms are crucial for detecting server failures quickly. This allows the system to take corrective actions, such as reallocating tasks and ensuring the overall stability and efficiency of the distributed system.

How Heartbeat Works:

Periodic Messages: Each server sends a regular signal, called a heartbeat, to a central monitoring server or to other servers in the system. This signal shows that the server is alive and functioning.
Monitoring: If the system doesn’t receive a heartbeat from a server within a certain time, it assumes the server might have failed.
Taking Action: When a server is suspected to be down, the system stops sending requests to that server and shifts the workload to another healthy server. This helps prevent further issues and keeps the system running smoothly.
Types of Heartbeat Mechanisms:

Centralized: All servers send their heartbeat messages to a central monitoring server. The central server keeps track of all the servers' status.
Decentralized: Servers send heartbeat messages to a random set of other servers. This way, each server keeps track of the others.
17. Define checksum. How does it work?
A checksum is a method used in distributed systems to ensure that data has not been corrupted during transfer. When data moves between different parts of a system, it can sometimes get damaged due to issues with storage devices, networks, or software. A checksum helps detect this corruption, so the client receives an error instead of corrupted data.

Checksums are essential for ensuring data integrity in distributed systems. They help detect corruption during data transfer, allowing the system to provide accurate and reliable data to clients.

How Does a Checksum Work?

Calculating the Checksum: A cryptographic hash function, such as MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, or SHA-512, is used to calculate the checksum. This function takes the input data and produces a fixed-length string of letters and numbers, which is the checksum.
Storing the Checksum: When the system stores data, it also computes the checksum and stores it alongside the data.
Verifying the Data: When a client retrieves data, it also retrieves the checksum. The client then calculates the checksum of the received data and compares it with the stored checksum. If the checksums match, the data is considered intact. If not, the data is likely corrupted, and the client can choose to retrieve the data from another replica.
18. Define availability.
Availability in system design refers to how often a system is up and running, ready to perform its tasks. A highly available system is one that is almost always operational and accessible when needed.

High availability is crucial because it ensures users can access the system whenever they need it. This is especially important for services that need to be operational 24/7, like online stores, banking systems, or emergency services.

Key Points about Availability:

Uptime: This is the amount of time a system is running without interruptions. Higher uptime means better availability.
Redundancy: Systems often have backup components (like servers or databases) that can take over if the main ones fail. This helps keep the system available.
Fault Tolerance: The ability of a system to continue working even if some parts fail. This ensures the system remains available.
Recovery: How quickly a system can bounce back after a failure. Faster recovery means better availability.
19. What is consistency?
Consistency in system design means that all parts of the system have the same data at the same time. When one part of the system updates data, all other parts should see the updated data right away.

It ensures that everyone is working with the correct data.

Key Points about Consistency:

Uniform Data: Every part of the system should show the same data. If you change a piece of data, everyone should see the change immediately.
Synchronization: When data is updated, the system ensures that all parts are synchronized with the new information.
Reliability: Consistency helps make the system reliable because users can trust that the data they see is accurate and up-to-date.
20. What is meant by latency?
Latency in system design refers to the time it takes for a request to travel from the user to the system and back again with a response. In simpler terms, it’s the delay between when you ask for something and when you get it.

Lower latency is important because it makes systems faster and more efficient, providing a better experience for users. This is especially crucial for real-time applications like video calls, online gaming, or financial trading systems.

Key Points about Latency:

Response Time: The time it takes for the system to respond to a user’s request.
Speed: Lower latency means faster responses, which is better for user experience.
Performance: High latency can make a system feel slow and unresponsive.
21. What is throughput?
Throughput refers to the amount of work or data that a system can handle in a given period of time. It measures how much information the system can process and deliver efficiently.

High throughput ensures that the system can serve more users and process more data quickly, which is crucial for performance and user satisfaction.

Key Points about Throughput:

Data Processing: It indicates how many requests or transactions a system can process per second, minute, or hour.
Capacity: Higher throughput means the system can handle more tasks or data in a shorter time.
Performance: Good throughput is essential for systems that need to handle a large number of users or a high volume of data.
22. What is meant by scalability in system design?
Scalability in system design refers to the ability of a system to handle increased load or demand by adding more resources. A scalable system can grow and manage more work without compromising performance.

Key Points about Scalability:

Handling Growth: The system can support more users, data, or transactions as demand increases.
Resource Addition: Resources like servers, storage, or bandwidth can be added to improve capacity.
Maintaining Performance: The system remains efficient and responsive even as it scales up.
Learn more about scalability in system design.

23. What is partition tolerance?
Partition tolerance refers to a system’s ability to continue operating even if there are network partitions. A network partition occurs when there is a breakdown in communication between different parts of the system.

Partition tolerance is crucial for maintaining system reliability and availability. It ensures that the system can withstand network issues and continue to function properly.

Key Points about Partition Tolerance:

Network Issues: It ensures the system still works even if some parts can’t communicate with each other due to network failures.
Resilience: A partition-tolerant system can handle network problems without losing data or functionality.
Reliability: Ensures that the system remains reliable and available even in the presence of network disruptions.
24. What are ACID properties?
ACID properties are a set of principles that ensure the reliable processing of database transactions. They stand for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.

1. Atomicity:

Definition: Ensures that each transaction is all-or-nothing.
Explanation: If a transaction is interrupted or fails, the system leaves no partial changes; it either completes fully or not at all.
2. Consistency:

Definition: Ensures that transactions move the database from one valid state to another.
Explanation: Every transaction must follow the database rules (like constraints, triggers) so the database remains correct after the transaction.
3. Isolation:

Definition: Ensures that transactions do not interfere with each other.
Explanation: Even if transactions occur at the same time, each transaction should not see the intermediate states of others. It should appear as if transactions are executed one by one.
4. Durability:

Definition: Ensures that once a transaction is committed, it will not be lost.
Explanation: After a transaction is completed, the changes it made are permanent, even if the system crashes.
25. Define the CAP theorem.
The CAP theorem is a principle that states a distributed system can only provide two out of the following three guarantees at the same time: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.

Consistency: Every read receives the most recent write or an error.
Availability: Every request receives a (non-error) response, without guaranteeing it contains the most recent write.
Partition Tolerance: The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes.
Key Points:

Trade-offs: You can only choose two out of the three guarantees. For example, if you want consistency and availability, you may have to sacrifice partition tolerance.
Practical Implications: Different systems prioritize different combinations based on their specific needs and requirements.

26. Explain the difference between horizontal scaling and vertical scaling.
Horizontal scaling, also known as scaling out, involves adding more machines or nodes to a system. Instead of upgrading the capacity of existing servers, you add more servers to share the load.

Key Features of Horizontal Scaling:

Adding More Machines: Increase the number of servers to handle more traffic or data.
Distributed Load: Workload is spread across multiple servers, which helps in balancing the load.
Flexibility: Easier to scale dynamically by adding or removing servers as needed.
Fault Tolerance: If one server fails, others can take over, improving reliability.
Example: If a website experiences increased traffic, you add more servers to handle the additional load, ensuring the website remains responsive.

Vertical Scaling:

Vertical scaling, also known as scaling up, involves adding more resources (CPU, RAM, storage) to an existing machine. Instead of adding more servers, you make the current server more powerful.

Key Features of Vertical Scaling:

Upgrading Existing Machines: Enhance the capabilities of a single server by adding more resources.
Increased Capacity: The server can handle more load due to increased resources.
Simplicity: Easier to implement since it involves upgrading existing hardware.
Limitations: There is a limit to how much you can upgrade a single server before hitting physical or cost constraints.
Example: Upgrading a server's CPU and RAM to handle more concurrent users or larger datasets.

Differences Between Horizontal Scaling and Vertical Scaling:

Approach:
Horizontal Scaling: Adds more servers to share the load.
Vertical Scaling: Upgrades the existing server to increase capacity.
2. Implementation:

Horizontal Scaling: Requires distributing data and traffic across multiple servers.
Vertical Scaling: Involves adding more resources to a single server.
3. Flexibility:

Horizontal Scaling: More flexible as you can add or remove servers based on demand.
Vertical Scaling: Less flexible due to hardware limitations and potential downtime during upgrades.
4. Fault Tolerance:

Horizontal Scaling: Higher fault tolerance since the failure of one server can be compensated by others.
Vertical Scaling: Lower fault tolerance as the failure of the upgraded server can cause significant issues.
5. Cost:

Horizontal Scaling: Can be cost-effective in the long run, especially with cloud services that allow pay-as-you-go models.
Vertical Scaling: Can become expensive as hardware upgrades are limited and may require significant investment.
6. Performance:

Horizontal Scaling: Can handle very large scale applications by adding more servers.
Vertical Scaling: Limited by the maximum capacity of the hardware.
27. What is sharding?
Sharding is a method used to split a database into smaller, more manageable pieces called shards. Each shard holds a subset of the data. Sharding helps distribute data across multiple servers, improving performance and scalability.

Key Points about Sharding:

Data Distribution: Data is divided into smaller parts (shards) and stored on different servers.
Improved Performance: Spreads the load across multiple servers, making data access faster.
Scalability: Makes it easier to handle large amounts of data by adding more servers to store additional shards.
Example: A large user database is split into shards where each shard holds user data for a specific range of user IDs.

28. Difference between sharding and partitioning.
Difference Between Sharding and Partitioning:

Concept:
Sharding: Specifically refers to dividing a database into smaller parts and distributing these parts across different servers.
Partitioning: A broader term that means dividing a database into smaller parts, which could be stored on the same or different servers.
2. Types:

Sharding: A form of horizontal partitioning where each shard is a horizontal slice of the data.
Partitioning: Can be horizontal (rows) or vertical (columns). Horizontal splits rows into different tables, while vertical splits columns into different tables.
3. Implementation:

Sharding: Often used to handle large databases by spreading the data across multiple servers.
Partitioning: Used to manage large databases by breaking them into more manageable parts, which may or may not be distributed across multiple servers.
Example of Sharding: A customer database is divided such that customers from different regions are stored in different shards on different servers.

Example of Horizontal Partitioning: A sales database is split by year, with each year's data in a different table, possibly on the same server.

Example of Vertical Partitioning: A user database is divided so that basic user info (name, email) is in one table, and additional user info (address, preferences) is in another table, both on the same server.

29. SQL database vs. NoSQL database.
Differences between SQL and NoSQL database:

SQL Databases:

Structure:
Tables and Rows: Data is stored in tables with rows and columns, much like a spreadsheet.
Schema: Follows a fixed schema, meaning the structure of the data is predefined.
2. Query Language:

SQL: Uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to define and manipulate data. SQL is standardized and widely used.
3. Consistency:

ACID Properties: Ensures data consistency with ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties.
4. Examples:

MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.
5. Use Cases:

Suitable for complex queries and transactions. Often used in applications where data integrity and relationships between data are important, like banking systems.
NoSQL Databases:

Structure:
Flexible Models: Data can be stored in various formats like documents, key-value pairs, wide-columns, or graphs.
Schema-less: Does not require a predefined schema, allowing for more flexibility with data types and structures.
2. Query Language:

Various: Does not use SQL. Instead, different NoSQL databases have their own query languages and methods for data manipulation.
3. Scalability:

Horizontal Scaling: Designed to scale out by adding more servers easily, which makes them suitable for handling large amounts of data and high traffic.
Learn how horizontal scaling works in SQL databases.
4. Examples:

MongoDB (Document), Redis (Key-Value), Cassandra (Column-Family), Neo4j (Graph).
5. Use Cases:

Suitable for big data and real-time web applications. Often used in situations where data structure can change over time, like social networks or content management systems.
30. Describe the different consistency patterns in system design.
Different Types of Consistency Patterns in System Design:

Strong Consistency:
Definition: Every read receives the most recent write.
How it Works: When data is written, all subsequent reads will see that write. There is no lag between writing data and being able to read the updated data.
Example: In a banking system, once you transfer money, your balance is updated immediately across all platforms.
Use Case: Critical systems where it's important that all users see the latest data instantly.
2. Eventual Consistency:

Definition: Data will become consistent over time, but not necessarily immediately.
How it Works: When data is written, it might not be immediately reflected in all parts of the system. However, given enough time, all parts of the system will eventually reflect the write.
Example: Social media posts where some users might see the post immediately, while others see it after a few seconds or minutes.
Use Case: Systems where it is acceptable for data to be temporarily inconsistent, like social media or user-generated content platforms.
3. Causal Consistency:

Definition: Ensures that operations that are causally related are seen by all processes in the same order.
How it Works: If one operation depends on another, all nodes will see these operations in the same sequence. Operations that are not causally related can be seen in different orders.
Example: In a collaborative document editing tool, if one user makes a change and another user comments on that change, everyone will see the change before the comment.
Use Case: Systems where understanding the order of events is important, like collaborative tools or chat applications.
4. Read-Your-Writes Consistency:

Definition: Ensures that once you have written data, you will always see your own updates in subsequent reads.
How it Works: After a write operation by a user, all future reads by that same user will reflect that write.
Example: After updating your profile information on a website, when you refresh the page, you see the updated information.
Use Case: User-specific data updates where users need to see their own changes immediately.
5. Monotonic Read Consistency:

Definition: Ensures that if a process reads a value, any subsequent reads will return that value or a more recent one.
How it Works: If you read data and then read it again later, you will not see any older version of the data.
Example: If you check your email inbox and see a new email, you will not see an empty inbox in the next refresh.
Use Case: Systems where it’s important to see updates in a progressive manner, like email clients or version control systems.
6. Monotonic Write Consistency:

Definition: Ensures that writes by a process are applied in the order they were issued.
How it Works: If a process writes data in a certain sequence, these writes will be seen in that order by everyone.
Example: In a logging system, log entries written in order will be read in the same order.
Use Case: Systems where the order of operations is critical, like transaction processing or logging systems.

31. Define Leader Election.
Leader election is a process used in distributed systems to designate one node (a leader) to coordinate tasks and make decisions on behalf of the entire system.

This is crucial for maintaining order and reliability in a distributed system.

Key Points about Leader Election:

Coordination: The leader coordinates tasks among all nodes, ensuring that the system runs smoothly.
Decision Making: The leader makes important decisions, like assigning tasks or handling conflicts.
Fault Tolerance: If the leader fails, a new leader is elected to take over, ensuring continuous operation.
32. Identify some design issues in distributed systems.
Designing distributed systems comes with several challenges. Here are some of the key issues:

Heterogeneity:

Definition: Distributed systems often involve different types of computers and networks working together.
Challenge: Ensuring that all these different systems can communicate and work together smoothly can be difficult.
Solution: Using standard internet protocols can help mask the differences and allow various systems to communicate effectively.
2. Openness:

Definition: Openness refers to how easily a system can be extended or modified.
Challenge: In distributed systems, it’s important to be able to add new services or update existing ones without disrupting the entire system.
Solution: Designing the system with open standards and clear interfaces can help make it easier to extend and modify.
3. Security:

Definition: Security involves protecting the data and operations of the system from unauthorized access and ensuring data integrity.
Challenge: Ensuring the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of data across different systems and networks can be tough.
Solution: Implementing strong encryption, authentication, and access control measures can help protect the system.
4. Scalability:

Definition: Scalability is the ability of the system to handle an increasing amount of work or users.
Challenge: Designing a system that can grow and still perform well as the number of users and requests increases.
Solution: Planning for scalability from the beginning, such as using load balancing and distributing data across multiple servers, can help manage increased loads.
5. Failure Handling:

Definition: In a distributed system, different parts of the system might fail independently.
Challenge: Identifying and managing these partial failures without affecting the overall system performance.
Solution: Implementing fault-tolerance measures, such as redundancy and regular monitoring, can help ensure the system remains operational even when some components fail.

Advanced System Design Questions
1. Design FB Messenger.
Functional Requirements:

One-on-One Conversations: Messenger should support direct conversations between two users.
Online/Offline Status: Messenger should show whether users are online or offline.
Chat History Storage: Messenger should save chat history so users can view past messages.
Non-Functional Requirements:

Real-Time Chat: Users should experience minimal delay while chatting.
Consistency: Users should see the same chat history on all their devices.
High Availability: The system should be reliable and available most of the time, even if it means sometimes prioritizing consistency over availability.
High-Level Solution:

At a high level, we need a chat server that will handle all communications between users. When a user sends a message, it goes through the chat server, which then delivers it to the recipient and stores it in a database.


Detailed Workflow:

Sending the Message:
Step 1: User-A sends a message to User-B through the chat server.
Step 2: The server receives the message and sends an acknowledgment back to User-A, confirming it got the message.
2. Storing and Delivering the Message:

Step 3: The server stores the message in a database to keep a record of the chat history.
Step 4: The server sends the message to User-B.
3. Receiving the Message:

Step 5: User-B receives the message and sends an acknowledgment back to the server.
Step 6: The server notifies User-A that User-B has successfully received the message.

Key Points to Consider:

Real-Time Experience:
Use WebSockets to maintain a constant connection between users and the chat server for instant message delivery.
2. Consistency:

Ensure that the chat history is updated and consistent across all devices by syncing the messages through the central server.
3. High Availability:

Use replication and failover strategies to ensure that the chat server remains available even if some parts of the system fail.

2. Design Twitter Search.
Twitter is one of the most popular social networking platforms for sharing news, pictures, and other media.

Suppose Twitter runs with the following conditions:

User Base:
1.5 billion total users.
800 million daily active users.
2. Tweet Volume:

400 million tweets per day.
Average tweet size: 300 bytes.
3. Search Frequency:

500 million searches per day.
4. Search Query:

Multiple words combined with AND/OR.
High-Level Solution:

To design a Twitter search service, we need to store all tweets in a database and build an index that tracks which words appear in which tweets. This index will help us quickly find the tweets users are searching for.

Detailed Design:

Storing Tweets:
Use a distributed database to store tweets.
Each tweet is stored with metadata such as user ID, timestamp, and tweet content.
2. Building the Index:

Create an inverted index, which maps each word to the tweets that contain it.
The inverted index will help in quickly finding tweets that match the search query.
3. Search Process:

When a user searches for tweets, the query is parsed to identify the words.
The system uses the inverted index to find tweets containing these words.
Combine results based on AND/OR conditions specified in the query.
Workflow:

Tweet Storage:
When a user posts a tweet, the tweet is stored in the database.
The tweet's content is also processed to update the inverted index. Each word in the tweet is added to the index with a reference to the tweet ID.
2. Search Operation:

A user submits a search query.
The query is parsed into individual words.
The inverted index is queried to find tweets containing these words.
Results are combined based on the AND/OR conditions.
The matched tweets are returned to the user.

Key Considerations:

Handling Large Data Volumes:
Use a distributed database to handle the large volume of tweets.
Ensure the database is scalable to accommodate growing tweet volumes.
2. Efficient Indexing:

The inverted index should be kept in memory for fast access.
Regularly update the index as new tweets are posted.
3. Search Optimization:

Optimize the search algorithm to handle high query volumes efficiently.
Use techniques like caching frequently searched queries to reduce load.

3. Design a Facebook news feed.
To design an FB news feed, consider the following requirements:

When a user creates a post, the post is sent to the web server.
The web server forwards the post to the application server.
The application server stores the post in the posts database and cache.
The media (photos, videos) are stored in blob storage.
2. Generating the Newsfeed:

The newsfeed generation service collects posts from people, pages, and groups the user follows.
The service ranks these posts based on relevance.
The ranked posts are stored in the cache for quick access.
Live updates are integrated into the newsfeed in real-time.
3. Delivering the Newsfeed:

When a user requests their newsfeed, the web server retrieves the pre-generated feed from the cache.
The feed is then sent to the user with minimal delay.
4. Real-Time Updates:

The feed notification service alerts the user to new posts.
The newsfeed generation service continuously updates the feed with new posts.
Key Points to Consider:

Low Latency: Ensure that the newsfeed is updated and delivered to the user with minimal delay.

11. Design an API Rate Limiter.
An API rate limiter is a system that controls the number of requests a user can make to an API within a specific time frame. This helps maintain the stability and security of the service while ensuring fair usage by all users. Examples of services that use API rate limiting include GitHub and Google Maps API.

Design an API Rate Limiter:

Understand the Requirements:
Rate-Limiting Policy: Define how many requests are allowed per minute or per second.
Scope of Limits: Determine if the limits apply per user, IP address, or API endpoint.
2. Design the Rate-Limiting Mechanism:

Fixed Window: Limits the number of requests in fixed time intervals.
Sliding Window: Limits requests within a rolling time frame.
Token Bucket: Allows requests as long as there are tokens in the bucket, replenished at a fixed rate.
3. Store Rate-Limiting Data:

Use in-memory data structures or distributed data stores like Redis to keep track of rate-limiting information.
4. Implement Middleware:

Create middleware to enforce rate limits before requests reach the main application logic.
5. Handle Distributed Systems:

Use consistent hashing or distributed locks to synchronize rate limits across multiple servers.
6. Monitor and Adjust:

Continuously monitor performance and adjust rate limits as needed to balance user experience and system stability.
Detailed Workflow:

Defining the Rate-Limiting Policy:
Decide the limit on the number of requests (e.g., 100 requests per minute).
Determine the scope (e.g., limit per user, per IP address, or per API endpoint).
2. Implementing the Rate-Limiting Mechanism:

Fixed Window: Count requests in fixed intervals. If the limit is exceeded within the window, block further requests until the next interval.
Sliding Window: Count requests in a rolling time frame. This provides a smoother limiting experience.
Token Bucket: Tokens are added to the bucket at a steady rate. Each request uses a token. If the bucket is empty, the request is denied.
3. Storing Rate-Limiting Data:

Use Redis or similar in-memory data stores to quickly read and write rate-limiting data.
4. Creating Middleware:

Middleware intercepts requests, checks the rate limit, and enforces it. If the limit is exceeded, the middleware responds with an error message.
5. Handling Distributed Systems:

Synchronize rate limits across servers using consistent hashing or distributed locks to ensure accurate counting.
6. Monitoring and Adjusting:

Monitor the system to see how the rate limits affect performance.
Adjust the limits based on usage patterns and system stability.

12. Design DropBox or Google Drive.
A file storage system is a service that allows users to store their data on remote servers instead of on their local devices. These servers are maintained by cloud storage providers and are accessible to users over a network, typically the Internet. Users can store, access, and manage their files from anywhere, as long as they have an internet connection. They usually pay a monthly fee for this service based on the amount of storage they use.

Requirements to design Dropbox/Google Drive:

Upload and Download:
Users should be able to upload and download their files/photos from any device.
2. File Sharing:

Users should be able to share files or folders with other users.
3. Automatic Synchronization:

The service should support automatic sync between devices. Any update on one device should reflect on all devices.
4. Support for Large Files:

The system should support storing large files, up to a GB.
5. ACID Properties:

Ensure Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability for all file operations.
6. Offline Editing:

Users should be able to add, delete, or modify files while offline, and sync changes when they go online.
Extended Requirements:

Version Control:

The system should support snapshotting of the data, allowing users to revert to any previous version of files.
High-Level Solution:

Workspace Folder:
Users will specify a folder on their device as the workspace. Any changes in this folder (adding, modifying, deleting files) will be synced to the cloud.
2. Cloud Storage:

Files and their metadata (file name, size, directory, shared status) will be stored on remote servers maintained by the cloud provider.
3. Metadata Management:

Metadata servers will store information about files and users in a SQL or NoSQL database.
4. File Synchronization:

Synchronization servers will notify all clients about updates so they can sync their files.
Detailed Design:

File Storage:
Block Servers: These servers handle file uploads and downloads. When a user uploads a file, the block server stores it in cloud storage.
Metadata Servers: These servers manage file metadata. They keep track of file names, sizes, directories, and sharing information.
2. Automatic Synchronization:

Sync Servers: These servers manage the workflow of notifying all clients about updates. Whenever a file is updated, the sync server ensures that all devices receive the update notification.
3. Offline Editing:

Local Changes: When a user makes changes offline, these changes are stored locally.
Sync on Reconnection: As soon as the device goes online, the local changes are synced with the remote servers, and the updates are propagated to other devices.
4. Version Control:

Snapshotting: The system periodically takes snapshots of the files, allowing users to revert to any previous version.
