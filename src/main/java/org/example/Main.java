        //By internalizing these patterns, you'll become more efficient at solving LeetCode problems and increase your chances of acing coding interviews.



        // Press Alt+Enter with your caret at the highlighted text to see how
        // IntelliJ IDEA suggests fixing it.
        System.out.printf("Hello and welcome!");

        // Press Shift+F10 or click the green arrow button in the gutter to run the code.
